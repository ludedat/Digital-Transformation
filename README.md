CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Background
The rapid proliferation of Internet services, coupled with the growing global fascination with e-business, has significantly accelerated the shift from cash transactions to electronic payment platforms. This increasing adoption of digital lifestyles has led to profound changes in customer expectations from financial service providers  (Aduaka & Awolusi, 2020). By 2015, China's e-commerce market was valued at approximately £350 billion, and it was projected to surpass the combined e-commerce values of the UK, Germany, France, Japan, and the U.S. by 2020 (Manzoor et al., 2021) . According to (Mittal & Kaur, 2013) the lower costs associated with electronic transactions are driving a growing number of individuals to transition from paper-based to electronic means of conducting business. Furthermore, technology is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the success of organizations, particularly in the banking sector. Consequently, both domestic and international banks are investing heavily in providing their customers with access to cutting-edge e-banking technologies, driven by customer responses and behaviours towards technology adoption. This aligns with the social construction of technology theory, which posits that human actions and behaviours play a pivotal role in shaping the development and adoption of technology (Blazi & Awolusi, 2020)
What is Customer Relationship Management (CRM)?
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) often refers to software systems designed to optimize customer interactions and enhance business processes. Popular platforms like Workwise and Salesforce (Sunkari, 2022) serve as comprehensive tools that offer data analysis and streamlined processes to form the backbone of customer insights and strategic planning. These systems empower businesses to gain a deep understanding of their target market, track competitive dynamics, and monitor customers both as distinct groups and as individuals. The true power of CRM lies in its ability to enable companies to stay attuned to the evolving needs and desires of their customers, ensuring that they can anticipate and meet market demands effectively (Stringfellow et al., 2004).
The central focus of the CRM system for Access bank is to decode what customers and the broader marketplace seek and to deliver it with precision. By leveraging data-driven insights, the bank can make continuous improvements that not only foster stronger customer loyalty but also create a more tailored and satisfying customer experience. CRM systems provide the tools necessary to craft marketing strategies that resonate with specific audience segments, ensuring that outreach efforts are conducted on the most effective platforms and address the unique needs of targeted customer groups. This precision in marketing and customer engagement is crucial for attracting new customers and retaining existing ones, as it ensures that every interaction is meaningful and relevant.
CRM enables the bank to understand their customers, their habits, and requirements.
‘This Approach is used to create strategic choices about how to interact with customer’s and the right product placement in the market. The goal is a lasting customer relationship with the best overall experience.
CRM also uses data and insights analysis to continuously improve the customer experience, to increase the customer lifetime value (LTV), and decrease the costs of marketing, and mining new customers’ (Sunkari, 2022).
Fig.3
 
For commercial banks that invest in the right CRM tools, these insights become integral to the scope of any project. By incorporating data-driven customer insights into their product development and service delivery, departments can implement offerings that are truly valued by their customers. This not only enhances customer satisfaction but also positions the bank as a market leader that is in tune with customer preferences and market trends.
However, through the strategic use of social media and basic analytics, commercial banks can gather critical data on customer awareness, engagement, and sentiment.
By integrating CRM systems with social media and other marketing strategies, commercial banks can unlock deep insights into who their customers are and how they prefer to interact with products and services. This data-driven Approach enables commercial banks to address customer needs effectively, creating a seamless bridge between the customer and the banks offerings. In doing so, banks can enhance customer satisfaction, drive loyalty, and achieve long-term success in a competitive marketplace.
 According to (Awodu, 2023a) ‘The integration of digital technologies into the core business of the bank, fundamentally changing how they operate and deliver value to customers. This process includes the adoption of technologies such as mobile banking, online banking, and the use of big data analytics to better understand and serve customers.’  One of the major watersheds in the banking sector was the global financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent years where banks in the US and Europe collapsed and this has  significantly changed the way banks are operated and regulated (Dayant & Rajah, 2024). Though Access bank plc has overseas branches and representative offices in United Kingdom, Dubai, China, India, Lebanon, and  subsidiaries in many African countries such as Mozambique, Zambia, Congo, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa (Adelusi, 2020) . The Nigerian sector will be the focus of this dissertation.
Digital transformation and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) are pivotal in today's banking sector. This approach leverages vast amounts of data, transforming it into actionable insights that drive efficiency, innovation, and growth. ‘The role of data-driven analytics is multifaceted, encompassing predictive, prescriptive, and descriptive analytics, each contributing uniquely to the decision-making process. Predictive analytics forecasts future trends and behaviours, enabling proactive strategies(Ditshego, 2018)

Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
 
This essay explores these impacts with relevant statistics and examples. 
The choice of case study is Access Bank Nigeria Plc, ‘one of Nigeria's leading financial institutions which exemplifies digital innovations in particular and leading to fundamental changes in the financial services industry.’ (Ditshego, 2018). 
Compared to other industries, the Nigerian financial services sector has historically lagged in embracing digital innovation (Lottu et al., 2023). This sluggish pace of digital transformation can be attributed to the substantial costs and inherent risks associated with deviating from traditional, conservative practices that have long dominated the industry (LIJOKA, 2022). However, the rapidly evolving expectations and demands of customers necessitate a more dynamic and responsive approach. Financial service providers are increasingly recognizing that to remain competitive, they must invest heavily in digital transformation efforts. Consequently, there has been a marked increase in attention and spending on integrating advanced digital solutions to meet these ever-changing customer needs.
(Bari et al., 2022) informed that ‘Corporate sustainability must be viewed as a core component of business strategy to secure a lasting competitive advantage. The long-term viability of dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage hinges on the organization's overall commitment to corporate sustainability. Therefore, it is proposed that corporate sustainability functions as a crucial mediator between sustainable dynamic capabilities and enduring competitive advantage.’ The rapid pace of technological change and the critical role of customer satisfaction in banking, understanding the impact of digital transformation on CRM and profitability is critical. CRM systems contribute to actively develop and steadily increase customer loyalty. CRM allows companies to centralise and integrate both their transaction records and customer data, making this information accessible and manageable to all key stakeholders to identify the most loyal customers as postulated by (Gil-Gomez et al., 2020)

(Gil-Gomez et al., 2020)
Justification
The rationale for undertaking this research is multifaceted. First, while there is extensive literature on digital transformation in banking, there is a scarcity of empirical studies that focus specifically on the commercial bank context. Most existing studies have concentrated on developed economies, where the banking infrastructure and customer expectations significantly differ from those in emerging markets like Nigeria (Bughin et al., 2019). Therefore, this research aims to fill this gap by providing empirical evidence on how digital transformation impacts financial performance (profitability) in Nigerian banks, with a particular focus on CRM as a tool.
furthermore, customer relationships are strengthened through perceived improvements in the banking relationship and consequent loyalty towards the bank. (Leverin & Liljander, 2006)  By examining the extent of digital transformation initiatives at Access Bank Nigeria Plc and their effectiveness in enhancing CRM, this study seeks to uncover the correlation between digital transformation and profitability. This understanding is relevant for banks aiming to leverage digital tools to improve customer engagement and financial performance.
‘The impact of digitalization in the banking sector has significantly transformed customer preferences and expectations. Consequently, banks are increasingly adopting digital strategies to meet these evolving demands. In line with contingency theory, it is essential that this digital shift is harmonized with other key factors within commercial banks to ensure optimal performance. This study will also explore how this digital emphasis influences the relationship between banks and their customers.’ (Agnihotri, 2021)
Finally, the conclusion from this research will give practical recommendations for banks in Nigeria and similar emerging markets on how to effectively assess digital transformation to enhance CRM and profitability. This will both contribute to published academic literature and provide actionable insights for practitioners in the banking sector, thereby bridging the gap between theory and practice.

CHAPTER 2:
LITERATURE REVIEW
Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
The concept of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is as longstanding as the practice of business itself. It is regarded as a strategic approach aimed at increasing a company's revenue, enhancing service quality, and providing greater customer value through the fulfilment of customer needs. Fundamentally, CRM represents an amalgamation of various underlying principles from relationship marketing. (Khan, Samina et al., 2022).
Fig.4
 
 (PerfectView: What is CRM? 2018)
Access bank utilises CRM digital transformation as a strategic and comprehensive process in which she fundamentally changes and upgrades its approach, technology, and systems for managing and optimizing customer relationships.   The CRM digital transformation has been one of the key developments of the last decade, with new frontiers like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IOT influencing the direction of CRM platforms and technologies  (Singh, N. et al., 2020) 
Financial institution ‘often attempt to benchmark competitors or related service industries to improve new product development and other key business processes. Although much has been learned about innovation in banks and other financial institutions in recent research studies, gaps in knowledge of best practices and cross‐industry differences remain’ (Drew, 1995)
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the profitability of commercial banks. By prioritizing the cultivation of enduring relationships with customers, CRM strategies are instrumental in bolstering customer allegiance and augmenting financial returns. Through the strategic analysis of customer data, banks are empowered to discern the unique needs and preferences of their clientele, enabling the formulation of bespoke offerings and the refinement of customer service methodologies.
On the other hand, it was observed that as ‘the user becomes more familiar with the 
product, its novelty wears off and the product becomes less exciting. At the same time, with prolonged use it can also become less frustrating. As a result, the perceived quality of a product is likely to change.’ (Balina et al., 2022)
Customer relationship management (CRM) continues to provide a competitive advantage, yet questions persist regarding its effective deployment to benefit both customers and the bank. Conversely, knowledge management (KM) also demonstrates its value as a source of competitive advantage. 
Though CRM software actively tracks all business interactions and ongoing communications with current and potential customers of the bank the impact on the profit levels  is tangible  as they have increasingly been recognized for their potential to enhance profitability in commercial banks. Meanwhile, knowledge-oriented customer relationship management
uses a conceptual framework to manage the knowledge required for high quality relationships in a cost -effective way informed   (Farooq, 2019)
To what extent has Access Bank Nigeria Plc implemented digital transformation initiatives?

ENHANCING CRM DECISIONS WITH AI
Among the various advanced innovations for the industrial revolution, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first reported in the Summer Project report prepared by John McCarthy’s Dartmouth in 1956 (Steinhoff, 2021). This state-of-the-art technology that performs activities requires human thinking and facilitates many services, namely, AI-based face recognition, AI-induced voice recognition, Natural language processing, and robotic processes was optimised by Access bank to improve her processes and services leading to a sustained higher profit margin annually.

(Soubra, 2021) noted that Data is being created and multiplied with an incredible speed due to the capabilities offered by the rapid evolution of technology. Data are being collected from social media streams, web surfing, digital images, banking transactions records, emails, mobile applications, and countless other sources. Taking advantage of these opportunities, Access Bank implemented some products after using artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to enhance its CRM platform. 
(Naidu & Mashanda, 2017) Informed that cognitive analytics help banks achieve customer centricity by generating valuable insights from data in the core banking system and external sources to enable personalized customer experience, a bank that knows its customer preferences.
(Berman, 2013) quoted that Big data integrates a vast expanse of information characterized by its terabytes and petabytes of volume, necessitating advanced data storage solutions to accommodate its sheer size. It originates from diverse sources, requiring efficient data input mechanisms to capture information across various channels and devices.
(BAU Journal - Creative Sustainable Development, 2021) The vast influx of data generated by the extensive use of technology—encompassing mobile and internet usage, images, emails, databases, multimedia, and machine-to-machine communication (such as in smart homes and cars)—alongside routine business transactions, underscores the digital era's complexity. In 2020, Access Bank capitalized on these technological advancements and its mandate as a digitally-led international organization to navigate and overcome the challenges presented by the pandemic.(Ugah, 2020) and ‘In 2020, we forged new partnerships with technology leaders to deliver cutting edge digital solutions that provide the following benefits for our customers: improved time to value through collaborative execution; access to debt capital for partners and third-party companies, ease of integration to the Bank’s platforms and new products and services evolution’ (Access bank nigeria plc – annual report, 2020.2020a) in  bid to streamline customer transactions Access Bank designed and developed a biometric payment solution named FacePay which uses AI and ML to carry out transactions using facial recognition. With this app, customers at physical branches and merchant locations no longer need to wait in line for service. This cutting-edge digital service empowers customers to conveniently transact using the face authentication mechanism, simply by taking a quick selfie, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience according to (Awodu, 2023d).

Access Bank also provides Business to Business (B2B) digital solutions. ‘Our leading initiative in this realm is known as PrimusPlus, a web application that simplifies cash and cheque payments across multiple banks for corporate users.’ (Statista, 2024)

CHAPTER 3:
METHODOLOGY
3.1 INTRODUCTION
The case study:
Digital transformation and CRM have fundamentally reshaped the global banking landscape. Nigerian banks, notably Access Bank, have embraced these innovations to elevate customer experience, streamline operations, drive efficiency, and significantly boost profitability.
Digital Transformation
Different definitions of digital transformation are available. For example, some researchers think that adopting and implementing innovation, such as mobile phones, digital communication, etc., to improve organisational operations (Fitzgerald et al., 2014), improving the customer experience of services using digital means.
Though Digital Financial Services encompass a range of innovations transforming the financial system's operations. These services leverage cutting-edge technologies across various sectors, including banking, insurance, oil and gas, and education, to facilitate efficient, safe, and secure transactions. In banking, this evolution is evident through the adoption of technologies such as Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs), Mobile Banking, Point of Sale (POS) systems, also known as Agency Banking, and Web Services. Similarly, insurance companies and other financial institutions are also integrating these technological advancements into their operations and service offerings.(Austin-Olowo et al., 2022)
Information technology or digital transformation has a positive relationship with economic growth while innovation is viewed as capabilities of actors (firms, organizations, academic institutes, and individuals) in science and technology to innovate in products, processes, and services backed mainly through the intensity of investment in research and development (R&D)  (Shirazi & Hajli, 2021)
Digital transformation has emerged as a dominant trend in recent years, fundamentally reshaping industries, economies, and societies worldwide. Countries like the United States, China, and Singapore are at the forefront of this transformation, driving rapid advancements in technology and digital infrastructure. These nations are widely regarded as leaders in the global digital transformation movement, setting benchmarks for others to follow. Consequently, the implementation of digital transformation has become an inevitable necessity not just for countries but also for companies seeking to remain competitive. However, the success or failure of these initiatives remains a critical concern, demanding careful consideration and strategic planning. (Nguyen-Thi-Huong et al., 2023a)
Access Bank PLC is listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Access Bank is a prominent full-service commercial bank with an extensive network comprising more than 600 branches and service outlets. The bank operates 3,000 ATMs and employs over 28,000 staff members. and services 45 million customers (VMware, 2022)
This research employed a quantitative approach to investigate the impact of digital transformation on CRM and profitability at Access Bank Nigeria Plc.
CRM refers to a strategy, a set of tactics, and a technology that has become indispensable in the modern economy.(Kumar, Vineet & Reinartz, 2018). The study utilizes secondary data from the bank’s financial statements and performance reports over a five-year period. Statistical analysis is conducted using MS Excel to identify correlations or trends, Power BI for visualization, and regression analysis is applied to determine the impact of digital transformation and CRM on profitability metrics. The research adheres to ethical considerations, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data used. The findings from this study will contribute to the understanding of digital transformation in the banking sector (Bharadwaj et al. 2013; Bughin et al.2019; Kumar & Reinartz, 2018; Agnihotri, 2021).
The following chapters provides a detailed aspects regarding which CRM model impacted on the profitability levels of the bank, along with the process of implementation, evaluation, and factor analysis. The ethical considerations and the risks aligned have also been included.  
3.2. Research Design
Quantitative Research:
Financial Data Analysis: 
Financial reports from Access Bank Nigeria were used to analyse profitability metrics of Access Bank at both pre and post implementation of digital transformation and CRM systems.
I will include relevant information regarding the volume of Mobile and Internet Banking transactions which could be gathered from secondary data from financial statements and performance reports of the bank over a period of 5 years (2019-2023).
Data Analysis: 
Statistical analysis is performed using  MS Excel and Power BI to identify correlations or trends. Furthermore, Regression analysis will be used to determine the impact of digital transformation and CRM on profitability metrics.
(Austin-Olowo et al., 2022) defined  regression model is a statistical method used to assess the influence, effectiveness, or relationship between variables. It helps determine how significantly independent variables affect the dependent variable.

Survey in appendix

Research Model
Based on research objectives and referring to previous research by (Ogbonna, 2022) (Kriebel & Debener, 2019) , (Bughin et al., 2019)  research model is described as follows: 
Bank performanceit = αi + β1Digital Transformationit + β1Controlvariablesit + εit 
Bank performance: αi+β1DigitalTransformationit+β2Controlvariablesit+ϵit
In which the research variables in the model are described in detail as follows:
Bank performance: The performance of banks is described through two representative indexes, ROE (return on equity) and ROA (return on assets). These are two common indicators chosen by many researchers as a proxy for performance.
Digital transformation: Based on text analysis, this study scans the annual reports of each bank. Words related to digital transformation in banking, such as Technology, Internet, digitization, Fintech, ATM, etc., are considered keywords related to digital transformation. Therefore, the number of words related to digital transformation will represent the level of digital transformation in Access Bank Nigeria Plc and sample banks.

Reliability Test.
Before distributing the questionnaires, a validity test using Cronbach's alpha was conducted on the initial 30 respondents to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness.
Cronbach’s alpha is computed by correlating the score for each scale item with the total score  for each observation (usually individual survey respondents), and then comparing that to the variance for all individual item scores. (Singh, A. S., 2017)
The Cronbach's alpha result for the questionnaire data is 0.912, indicating a high level of internal consistency among the survey items.

A high Cronbach's alpha suggests that the questionnaire items are highly correlated, and the survey is reliable.(Taber, 2018)
Demographic Analysis 
Consumer demographics is defined as the’ consumer characteristics like age, income, gender, literacy, and education. Consumer demographics are crucial in services marketing as they influence decision-making and choices (Manyanga et al., 2022).
Consumer demographics refer to the statistical characteristics of a population used to identify different consumer segments within a market. These demographics help businesses understand who their customers are, which in turn informs product development, marketing strategies, and sales tactics.(Mwirigi et al., 2018)
DATA
The objective is to compare financial performance and digital transformation among Access Bank Nigeria Plc and other local banks from 2019 to 2023. Financial data was collected from financial statements and annual reports, with additional data sourced from Bloomberg platforms. Digital transformation metrics was derived by analyzing and counting relevant words and phrases in annual reports. Collected data were encrypted and organized in Microsoft Excel and Power BI (version 2.131.1203.0) for analysis. "This is attributable to the comprehensive capabilities of both tools, which include extensive support for various data forms and formats, as well as the integration of user-driven analysis across spreadsheets, text files, and databases."(Krishnan, 2017)

Digital Transformation
In the face of an increasingly competitive landscape, achieving cost efficiency has become a critical imperative for banks striving to maintain a competitive edge. By strategically embracing digital technologies, financial institutions can significantly lower their operational costs. This reduction is achieved through the automation of routine tasks, which minimizes the need for manual intervention, thereby reducing human error and improving accuracy. Additionally, the reliance on physical infrastructure is dramatically diminished, leading to substantial savings in overhead costs associated with maintaining and upgrading physical assets. Furthermore, the adoption of digital solutions enables the streamlining of complex processes, ensuring that resources are allocated more efficiently, and operational workflows are optimized. As a result, banks agility also drives down costs through inventory reduction  (Aslam et al., 2018)and responsiveness in a dynamic market environment.

Initially, preliminary information about variables were gathered. Subsequently, descriptive statistics techniques were employed. The results of the descriptive analysis indicate that the mean ROA achieved by access banks is 1.94 with a maximum of 3.10 and a minimum of 1.17. The average ROE is 0.115, with a maximum of 36.57 and a minimum of 13.92. The mean digital conversion of banks is 1.32915 (32 words related to digital transformation in each annual report), with a maximum of 146 words and a minimum of one word. Since keywords related to digital transformation have been collected since 2015, in the early stages, some banks rarely mentioned keywords related to digital transformation
Fig.10
 
The items listed from Access bank’s financial statements primarily reflect traditional financial categories and do not explicitly identify digital product directly.  However, these components are be embedded within categories listed below:
From banks Balance sheet
Net Fixed Assets:
Property, Plant & Equipment: ATMs, being tangible assets, are typically categorized under Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE). The cost of acquiring, installing, and maintaining ATMs are usually included here. Property, Some digital infrastructure, like servers and IT hardware supporting digital products, might also be included here.
Digital Products:
Total Intangible Assets:
Digital products such as proprietary software, digital banking platforms, or mobile apps are included under intangible assets because Access bank has capitalized the costs related to their development and acquisition.
Net Fixed Assets:
In Financial Statements, the specific costs associated with digital transformation or ATM networks are not usually itemized but rather aggregated within broader categories like fixed assets, intangible assets, or operating expenses.
financial reports publicly disclosed by the terms associated with financial digital transformation in the sample firms’ annual financial reports
Furthermore, the components that may relate to digital products or digital transactions are typically found under "Adjusted Total Non-Interest Income," which includes items like "Commissions & Fees Earned" and "Other Operating Income (Losses)."
Reason for choices.
Income adjusted sheet
Commissions & Fees Earned: This could include fees from digital banking services, such as online transfers, digital payments, or fees associated with the use of digital platforms (e.g., mobile banking apps).
Other Operating Income (Losses): This may include revenue from digital channels like fees for mobile banking, online banking services, or digital financial products (e.g., digital loans, e-wallets).
These categories are typically where income generated from digital products and services might be recorded in a bank's financial statements.
From the data gathered, the demographic analysis conducted on the bank customers respondents revealed male are 44%, females 54% while others are 2%.

Fig.12
Pie Chart
 
Most respondents are female, constituting 54% of the total sample. This indicates that a substantial portion of the customer base participating in the survey are female  (Claycomb et al., 2001). This trend is attributed to various factors, including targeted marketing strategies, specific product offerings and customer service practices that resonate particularly well with the female gender  (Hyllegard et al., 2010).
Access bank products that resonate with the female gender includes W Power Loan, Maternal Health Service Support (MHSS), W Community and Access Closa (Access Bank Plc, 2023) ; see Table 6 below for details.


Table: 6
Product	Benefit
W Power Loan:	gave women access to finance for their businesses.
Maternal Health Service Support (MHSS):	Offers financial support for women seeking fertility treatments, prenatal and postnatal care.
W Community:	A platform for women to network, share experiences, and access mentorship and training programs.
Access Closa:	Access Closa is an initiative that creates micro-branches in the form of booths placed in neighbourhoods across Nigeria. These booths are more approachable than traditional branches, making banking services more accessible to women who may find it challenging to visit a full-scale branch


From survey carried out, Males made up 44% of the respondents, highlighting a significant presence of male customers supported by (Belás et al., 2015). This gender balance among respondents helps ensure that the survey results are reflective of the broader customer base (Bjørshol & Larsen, 2023)
Survey Inclusivity
The "Other" category, though small at 2%, shows that the survey provides options for non-binary or other gender identities also proposed by  (Medeiros et al., 2020). This demonstrates  commitment to inclusivity, recognizing and respecting the diverse gender identities of their customers.
Gender Representation Across Age Groups:
The "<34" age group has the highest customer counts, suggesting a younger customer demographic,  a position reflected by (Camilleri & Grech, 2017)

Satisfaction Levels:
(Nwogwugwu, 2017) claimed that retention of customers has been identified as a delicate task for financial institutions. To retain customers, effective relations between the banks and customers is mandatory customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are not ends in themselves but rather have direct economic consequences such as a higher profitability and market share (Seiler et al., 2013) Seiler, V., Rudolf, M., & Krume, T. (2013). The influence of socio‐demographic variables on customer satisfaction and loyalty in the private banking industry. International Journal of Bank Marketing, 31(4), 235-258.

Data from Bloomberg terminals were analysed to show year-on-year performance across Access bank and benchmark with sister industry leaders’ ratios (not industry averages).
Digital Transformation Metrics:
(Bari et al., 2022) indicated that Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  from bank balance sheets to measure profitability over the years in review include below listed:
a.	Demand Deposits
b.	Savings Deposits
c.	Interest-Bearing Deposits
d.	Customer Acceptances & Liabilities
e.	Total Deposits
f.	Net Loans

Fig.26
 
The analysis of dividend payout ratios across the four banks reveals a noteworthy disparity, with Zenith Bank and Sterling Bank notably trailing behind their counterparts. This information is crucial for investors who prioritize dividend income, as it provides clear insight into which banks are more committed to returning a higher portion of their earnings to shareholders. Understanding these payout trends enables investors to make informed decisions regarding the stability and profitability of their potential investments in the banking sector.

OVERALL SERVICE SATISFACTION:
It is a fact that Every business organization aims to primarily satisfy its customers, as the customer satisfaction lays foundation for the success of the business (Ramachandran & Chidambaram, 2012). The data analysed from the survey showed a general decline in satisfaction scores as age increases i.e. contrary to ‘ satisfaction increases with age’ (Tien et al., 2021)
 Fig.30
 
Data from the survey (Fig. 30 above) revealed that younger customers, specifically those under 34 years old, reported the highest satisfaction score of 65. In contrast, older customers, particularly those under 64 years old, recorded the lowest satisfaction score of 14. This highlights a significant disparity in satisfaction levels across different age groups. This view is supported in (Bakar & Adzis, 2024)  The accelerated and continuous advancement of cutting-edge technology, particularly in the realm of Financial Technology (commonly referred to as FinTech), has created substantial and ever-increasing pressure on traditional banking institutions to not only attract new customers but also to retain their existing customer base. This challenge is especially pronounced as younger generations, who have grown up in a world dominated by digital innovation, are significantly more technologically savvy, adaptable, and inclined towards adopting the latest technological trends. These younger consumers tend to gravitate more towards innovative financial solutions that are characterized by convenience, speed, and digital accessibility, which FinTech companies are exceptionally well-positioned to provide. As a result, banks are finding it increasingly difficult to meet the expectations of these tech-savvy individuals who demand seamless and efficient digital experiences in their financial transactions. This shift in consumer behavior has forced banks to rethink their strategies, invest heavily in digital transformation, and innovate their services to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving financial landscape dominated by technological advancements.
Service satisfaction
the group with more than 10 years of experience (83) had the highest sum of overall service satisfaction with the bank, however,  (Pont & McQuilken, 2005)  quoted that ‘Customer satisfaction is an important indicator for customer loyalty, and numerous studies have identified the benefits that customer loyalty delivers to an organisation. Nevertheless, research also suggests that satisfied customers still defect.’   The group with less than one year of experience had the lowest sum, totalling just 12. This was 59% lower than the group with more than 10 years of experience, which accounted for 44% of the total service satisfaction with the bank. The significant difference highlights the impact of experience on customer satisfaction ratings. ‘The real victory of an organization is based on the degree of loyalty of the customers.’ (Pont & McQuilken, 2005)

Across all 5 Time with Access bank Nig Plc, Sum of Overall service satisfaction with bank ranged from 12 to 83
Fig.31
 
Fig.32
 

Fig.31 & 32  above showed that in 2021 Access bank had the highest value growth at 14,881.53 and has sustained the lead till 2023, followed by Zenith Bank Nigeria at 12,591.49 and UBA at 11,229.45.


Loan Growth
Fig.33
 
Fig 33 above is a snapshot of the financial performance of four banks—Access, Sterling, UBA, and Zenith—specifically focusing on their total loan values and year-over-year loan growth. This analysis explored the underlying themes within the data, displaying the overall health and strategic positioning of these financial institutions in the lending market.
According to (Thiong & KIAMA, 2018) ‘Loan growth is an indication that the bank can seek out new profitable markets, thus leading improved profitability and cash flow positions. Loan growth can also be used to convey good or bad news regarding to the expected financial performance of banks.’
Because Loan growth is a critical indicator of Access bank’s strategic direction, reflecting its expansion in response to market conditions.
The highest loan growth (7,042.2591 units) suggests that Access Bank is aggressively expanding its lending operations.  A result of strategic initiatives to capture market share, potentially driven by favourable economic conditions or successful penetration into new markets.
Access vs Zenith Bank
The significant loan growth of Access Bank, coupled with high total loans, indicates a strategy of aggressive market expansion, which could involve higher risk tolerance.
Zenith bank’s more moderate growth, despite a similar total loan value, might indicate a balance between growth and risk management, potentially reflecting a strategy of sustainable expansion with controlled risk.  (Ferliana & Agustina, 2018) further explained ‘that firm size and managerial ownership had significant effect on capital structure, while company growth and business risk did not have significant effect on capital structure. Profitability able to significantly moderates the effect of company growth and managerial ownership on capital structure’
Fig.34
 

The comprehensive analysis of Access Bank's full financial statements and annual reports, focusing on key performance indicators (KPI) related to its digital transformation initiatives introduced in 2021, demonstrated a noticeable marginal positive effect on profitability metrics in the subsequent year, 2022 and beyond.
 Access Bank Nigeria financial statement is audited by KPMG, one of the leading global auditing firms, ‘a specialist auditor in the banking industry’(Kanagaretnam et al., 2009)   known for its comprehensive audit methodologies and industry expertise. 

Discussion
Savings and Deposit Growth on Access Bank's Balance Sheet
The expansion of Access Bank's balance sheet is evidenced by multiple key indicators, including a growing customer base, heightened customer engagement, and enhanced financial performance. These metrics not only highlight the bank's ability to attract and retain customers but also underscore its overall financial robustness and strategic success in the competitive banking sector (Buchak et al., 2024).
Growth indicators:
1. Growth in Deposits:
Total Deposits: A rise in total deposits reflects a growing customer base or an increase in contributions from existing account holders, signaling enhanced trust and confidence in the institution’s financial services (Fatai & Alenoghena, 2024).
2. Loan Growth:
Total Loans and Advances: An increase in loans issued by the bank suggests higher customer demand for credit, indicative of customer growth (Briones et al., 2024)

Fig.35
 
Fig. 36
 
Retail Loans: Growth in personal loans, mortgages, and other consumer lending products points to an expanding retail customer base.
Corporate Loans: Increased corporate lending does indicate that more businesses are turning to Access bank for their financial requirments.
 Increase in Customer Accounts:
Number of New Accounts: A rise in the number of new accounts opened, both for individual and business customers, is a direct indicator of customer growth.
Customer Base Expansion: Growth in the overall number of customers (both retail and corporate) reflected in the bank's customer database.

Digital Assets And Employee Productivity
According to a case study by (Igudia, 2021), technological change has a significantly positive impact on employee productivity. Therefore, adopting new technology in the operations and service delivery of bank services ultimately enhances employees’ productivity.

A view of access Banks annual report  (2022) revealed trends and significant changes in customer behavior, such as the adoption of digital banking channels  which was captured succinctly by (BusinessDay, 2023) Deputy Group Managing Director, Roosevelt Ogbonna FCA, informed these investments have seen the Bank recording continuous sign on of new customers, thus making it the largest mobile banking network within Nigerian’s banking system, with 11 million customers using its mobile app. The bank is said to also leverage its’ agency banking platform, enabling customers transact commercial banks within their localities, rather than travel distances to do so. 
Access Bank leveraged the pandemic to accelerate the execution of its digital strategy and deliver optimised and uninterrupted services to customers during the period (Access bank nigeria plc – annual report, 2020.2020a).
The period brought about the realization that much could be accomplished beyond the confines of physical buildings and traditional office spaces. This insight prompted Access Bank to accelerate its digital transformation journey, striving to surpass those who had already begun their own. Recognizing the importance of staying ahead in a rapidly changing environment, the bank actively tested and incorporated digital tools across every aspect of its business operations. By investing in emerging technologies, the bank not only streamline its processes but also enhance customer experiences, ensuring that it remains competitive and responsive to the evolving needs of its clients in the digital age.
Fig. 39
 
Fig.40
 
the data showed Access Bank’s growth trajectory over these 3-year period, highlighting the importance of strategic adaptability and the effective management of internal resources to sustain and accelerate growth. 
2021:	The Sustainable Growth Rate for Access Bank in 2021 is £13.87. This figure serves as a baseline for the subsequent years and indicates that in 2021, Access Bank had a stable capacity to grow its business using internally generated resources. The SGR at this level informed that the bank was in a healthy financial position, able to sustain its growth without over-reliance on external financing.
2022:	The Sustainable Growth Rate dropped to £9.72, This reduction was attributed to a shift in strategy  (Access Bank Plc, 2023)A lower SGR showed that the bank was facing challenges while maintaining its previous growth trajectory which was due to increased competition and regulatory changes (Access Bank, 2023).

2023:	The year 2023 shows a significant rebound in the Sustainable Growth Rate, rising sharply to £32.07. This dramatic increase indicates a robust recovery and impact of the successful implementation of strategic initiatives that revitalized the bank’s growth potential. The substantial jump in SGR showed several positive developments: improved profitability, more efficient capital management and retail expansion. This high SGR indicated a strong financial position, Here Access Bank capitalized on its internal strengths and favourable market conditions to drive growth without the need for additional external financing (Access Bank, 2023).


‘In 2023, an app called AccessMore significantly expanded its reach by adding over 40 million customers across various African subsidiaries, including countries like Zambia, Kenya, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Rwanda, The Gambia, Cameroon, and Ghana. This growth highlights the app's increasing influence and the widespread adoption of digital banking solutions across the African continent.’ (BusinessDay, 2023)
Digital Transformation Metrics
Access banks invested in a robust private cloud, and the deployment of a rapidly scalable software-defined backend architecture that embraced the convergence of the private and public cloud which impacted positively measuring  the volume of Mobile and Internet Banking transactions between previous years and when deployed. 
An AI-Powered Chatbot, nicknamed “Ada,” was introduced to engage customers by providing round-the-clock support, efficiently handling inquiries, and swiftly resolving issues. This innovation significantly reduced wait times, thereby improving overall customer service efficiency (BusinessDay, 2023). Additionally, according to   (VMware, 2022), Access Bank's investment in VMware solutions played a key role in its ranking as the 65th among Nigeria's despite premier financial services institutions, demonstrating the impact of advanced technology on the bank’s success.
Based on data from Access Bank Nigeria’s financials and KPIs (Fig. 20), showed a tangible positive impact of digital transformation on its profitability:
Fig. 41
 
EFFECTIVENESS OF CRM STRATEGIES
How effective are the CRM strategies implemented through digital platforms by Access Bank Nigeria Plc?
It has been proven that retained customers are more profitable than newly acquired customers. Customer retention is the maintenance of continuous trading relationships with customers over a long period of time. Customer retention is the mirror image of customer defection. The higher an organisation’s retention rate, the lower will be its level of defection according to (Opara & Opara, 2016) In the banking industry, it is often more critical for institutions to prioritize managing the overall downward migration of customer spending rather than solely focusing on customer retention. Many customers do not necessarily defect; instead, they alter their buying behavior, which can significantly impact their overall value to the bank. Such changes in purchasing patterns can lead to more substantial shifts in customer value than outright defection. Therefore, while improving customer retention remains a key objective of CRM implementation, a comprehensive strategy that also addresses shifts in customer spending behaviour is essential for maximizing long-term profitability and customer lifetime value.
Increased Transaction Volume
Trading volume has strongly significant and positive influence on both ROE and ROA, suggesting that trading  volume is the determinant for the profitability; and finally, ROE is a more superior measure of profitability to ROA according to (Sayari & Shamki, 2016).
Access Bank reported a substantial growth in its digital transaction channels, with USSD transaction volumes surging by 62% year-over-year, and Mobile and Internet Banking transactions increasing by 67% year-over-year. This impressive expansion in digital transactions has significantly contributed to the bank's enhanced revenue and profitability. A deeper analysis of key performance indicators further highlights the positive impact of these digital channels on the bank's overall financial health.

Return on Assets (ROA): Return on Assets (ROA) is a critical financial metric that reflects a bank's ability to effectively utilize its assets to generate profits. It serves as an indicator of how efficiently the bank's management is employing its resources to maximize earnings. On the other hand, Return on Equity (ROE) measures the profitability relative to shareholders' equity and is a key indicator of the returns being generated for investors. ROE can be derived by multiplying ROA by the total assets-to-equity ratio, which in turn measures the financial leverage of the bank. Financial leverage, the proportion of total assets financed by equity, plays a crucial role in determining both ROA and ROE. Specifically, banks with lower leverage (i.e., higher equity) tend to exhibit higher ROA because they are less burdened by debt. However, this higher equity base also dilutes the return on equity, resulting in a lower ROE. 
While ROE is an important measure of profitability from the perspective of shareholders, it has limitations. ROE can be influenced by the level of leverage, which introduces greater financial risk. High leverage can artificially inflate ROE, masking the underlying risks associated with increased debt. This makes ROA a more reliable and holistic measure of a bank’s profitability, as it provides a clearer picture of the bank's ability to generate earnings independent of its capital structure. Thus, ROA emerges as the key ratio for evaluating bank profitability, offering a more balanced view that accounts for both operational efficiency and financial risk according to (Sayari & Shamki, 2016).
The increase in Access Bank’s digital transactions  played a pivotal role in improving the bank's ROA, a critical metric that measures the profitability generated from its total assets. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of digital channels, compared to traditional banking methods, have enabled the bank to optimize asset utilization, thus driving higher returns.
Deposits
Deposits were considered as banks’ main source of funding and are the lowest cost of funds. The more deposits were transformed into loans, the higher the interest margin and profit. Hence, deposits had positive impact on profitability of the banks. But if a bank 
could not transform its deposits into loans efficiently it might bring negative impact on profitability also (Islam et al., 2017).
The surge in digital transactions has also contributed to an overall increase in customer deposits. As customers increasingly engage with the bank through digital platforms, the convenience and accessibility of these services encourage higher deposit volumes. This growth in deposits strengthens the bank's liquidity position, enabling it to fund more loans and investments.
Savings Deposits: Specifically, savings deposits have seen a notable rise due to the bank’s emphasis on digital banking. The ease of access to savings accounts via mobile and internet platforms, coupled with innovative savings products tailored to digital customers, may have attracted more deposits. This not only enhances the bank’s ability to mobilize funds but also supports its strategy of building a stable, low-cost deposit base.
Interest-Bearing Deposits: The growth in digital transactions is also reflected in the increase in interest-bearing deposits. As more customers leverage digital platforms to manage their finances, they are more likely to opt for interest-bearing accounts that offer competitive returns. This shift contributes to the bank's interest income, further bolstering its profitability.

In summary, the remarkable growth in Access Bank's digital transaction volumes is not only a testament to its successful digital transformation strategy but also a key driver of its improved financial performance across crucial metrics such as ROA, deposits, savings deposits, and interest-bearing deposits. This trend underscores the vital role that digital innovation plays in the bank’s ability to enhance customer engagement, optimize operations, and achieve sustainable profitability.

“A marked improvement in the Return on Assets (ROA) indicates a more effective and judicious utilization of the bank’s assets. This enhancement is often driven by a strategic expansion in customer deposits and an increase in loan portfolios, both of which contribute to the bank’s ability to generate higher earnings from its asset base. Such an uptick in ROA reflects the bank’s successful efforts to optimize its resources, thereby reinforcing its overall financial stability and operational efficiency.”(Trujillo-Ponce, 2012)

The Y-O-Y asset growth (as reflected by the growth in total deposits) for access bank:
From 2020 to 2021, the total deposits experienced a remarkable increase, rising from £10,226.23 to £12,119.44, which represents an impressive growth rate of approximately 18.51%. This growth occurred despite the pervasive challenges posed by the global pandemic, which adversely affected economies and financial markets worldwide. Remarkably, the momentum continued into the following year. From 2021 to 2022, total deposits surged further, climbing from £12,119.44 to £16,589.11. This substantial growth, translating to an approximate rate of 36.88%, attributed to investment in digital assets and underscores the resilience and strategic positioning that enabled such a robust financial performance during a period of global uncertainty.
Growth in Deposits:
Total Deposits: A notable increase in total deposits within Access Bank serves as a critical indicator of both customer growth and financial stability. This upward trend suggests a dual phenomenon: firstly, it reflects an influx of new customers who are choosing to open accounts with Access Bank, driven potentially by the bank’s competitive offerings, enhanced services, or increased market presence. Secondly, it also indicates that existing customers are demonstrating heightened confidence in the bank’s financial health by increasing the deposit volume. 
The rise in total deposits is attributed to several underlying factors, including the bank’s successful marketing strategies, the introduction of innovative banking products that meet diverse customer needs, and a robust customer retention strategy that fosters long-term relationships. Additionally, an increase in deposits might also signify the bank’s pROActive engagement in digital banking channels, making it easier and more convenient for customers to manage their finances and deposit funds. 
Furthermore, this growth in deposits is not only a positive sign of customer loyalty and acquisition but also contributes to the bank’s overall liquidity. A larger deposit base provides Access Bank with greater financial flexibility, enabling it to expand its lending capacity, invest in new ventures, and meet regulatory requirements more comfortably. 
In a broader economic context, rising deposits within the bank can be seen as a microcosm of consumer confidence and economic stability, as individuals and commercial banks also are more likely to save and invest during times of economic certainty. Thus, the increase in total deposits at Access Bank is a multifaceted indicator that underscores the institution’s growing trust among customers and its strengthening position within the financial sector. ‘Deposits are an indispensable tool commercial banks use to enhance its profitability through advancing deposits mobilized to its customers in form of loans which make in return interest to commercial banks’ (Tuyishime et al., 2015)
Growth in Demand Deposits:
Increased demand deposits, such as checking accounts does indicate a significant rise in customer transactions and heightened overall engagement with the financial institution (Howard, 1906).

Efficiency Improvements: A substantial increase in demand deposits, particularly in checking accounts, often signifies a marked surge in customer transactions and a notable intensification of overall engagement with the financial institution A substantial increase in demand deposits, particularly in checking accounts, often signifies a marked surge in customer transactions and a notable intensification of overall engagement with the financial institution.(Howard, 1906)
Financial Inclusion:  Access Bank’s digital solutions have significantly expanded the accessibility of banking services, thereby broadening the potential customer base but also enhancing the volume of deposits. These developments are pivotal in driving profitability, as they enable the bank to reach underserved markets, foster customer loyalty, and optimize financial operations. By leveraging innovative technologies, Access Bank positions itself to capture a larger share of the market, thereby securing a competitive edge in an increasingly digital economy while digital finance technologies adopted have minimized operational costs hence impacting on overall Banks’ profitability. 
‘Digital finance technologies have been profitable since their implementation, yet they barely appear on the Bank's financial records.’ (Bett & Bogonko, 2017)
Innovation and Sustainability: Embracing digital technology to propel sustainability targets, such as CO2 management, indicates a long-term strategy that could lead to cost savings and enhanced corporate reputation, indirectly impacting profitability. A pivotal element of sustainability lies in the industry’s’ success in generating wealth . economic indicators transcend conventional financial reporting , describing wealth or value creation, distribution, and reinvesting of future growth, considering both human and financial capital. (Thiga, 2023)
Access Bank Nigeria’s digital transformation initiatives have demonstrably contributed the sum of £15.97 billion made from 1.6 billion digital transactions processed as of December 2020 to a significant enhancement in the bank’s overall profitability (Access bank nigeria plc – annual report, 2020.2020b). This positive impact is evidenced by a marked increase in revenue, which has been driven by higher transaction volumes resulting from the successful ‘adoption of digital channels which has leveraged technologies like Advanced Analytics, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics Process Automation to re-shape business operations and drove performance in a scalable manner’(Access bank nigeria plc – annual report, 2020.)  In addition, the bank has realized significant cost savings by digitizing 400 of its operational processes. This comprehensive digitization initiative has not only streamlined workflows but also enhanced operational efficiency through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. The automation and integration of these processes have minimized manual intervention, reduced errors, and accelerated transaction times, further contributing to the bank's overall performance. Collectively, these achievements highlight the strategic importance of Access Bank Nigeria's investment in digital transformation, demonstrating its pivotal role as a catalyst for the bank's sustained financial success.
Variable considered in the scope of this study is calculated using data gleaned from income statement and balance sheet stated below:
Fig. 48
 
The data indicates a challenging year in 2022, where the bank experienced a notable decrease in its ROE by 22.19%. However, 2023 marked a significant recovery, with the ROE increasing by 162.74%, more than doubling compared to the previous year. This dramatic improvement could be attributed to strategic financial decisions or enhanced operational efficiencies that boosted the bank's return on equity (VMware, 2022).

The regression analysis showed a moderate positive relationship between the dependent and independent variables, with an R Square of 0.3707 means the model explains about 37% of the variance. Meanwhile, the adjusted R Square is lower (0.2134), and the model’s predictive power is limited due to a high standard error and a small sample size. Furthermore, ANOVA results indicated limited explanatory power, with a low F-statistic and a non-significant p-value, indicating the model does not significantly explain the variability in the dependent variable. The intercept is also statistically significant, indicating a baseline ROE of 38.50 when NPA is zero, but the relationship between NPA and ROE is not significant. The negative NPA coefficient informs a potential association with lower ROE, but the evidence is low. Further analysis with more data and additional variables is provided in other sections of this report to support and improve this model's reliability and predictive capability for Access bank.
The analysis indicates that Non-Performing Assets (NPA) do not significantly affect Return on Assets (ROA) or Return on Equity (ROE) based on the current data. To establish a stronger relationship between NPA and financial performance, other metrics from different sections of this dissertation should be considered. While asset quality is crucial for all banks, it is especially important for the profitability and smooth operation of banks, which are vital components of financial markets. Asset quality relates to the quality of loans provided by the bank, often measured by Non-Performing Loans (NPL), which include overdue and follow-up loans (Kadioglu & Ocal, 2017).

Conclusion 
From the discussions above, the issue of digital transformation is a contemporary one that requires ongoing attention especially given the vast implications that it has on the banking system. However, this current study has gone a long way to evaluate the dynamics of digital transformation (CRM) in and the possible effects it has on the profitability of  Access bank by comparing it with contemporaries. ‘Applying digital transformation will help improve the bank’s reputation and attract more customers.’  (Nguyen-Thi-Huong et al., 2023b)
Digital Transformation Initiatives
The adoption of digital banking has fundamentally transformed traditional banking procedures, ushering in a new era of financial services characterized by efficiency, convenience, and enhanced user experiences. Access Bank Plc has been at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging a suite of cutting-edge technologies to redefine how financial services are delivered. These technologies include Blockchain, which ensures secure and transparent transactions; Data Science and Analytics, which enable the bank to harness vast amounts of data for informed decision-making; sophisticated algorithms that optimize financial processes; and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), which drive automation and personalization with minimal to no human intervention. Through the integration of these advanced tools, Access Bank Plc has not only streamlined operations but also set new standards for innovation in the financial sector (Awodu, 2023c)
The study found that Digital CRM positively impacts both strategic and operational CRM, enhancing bank profitability. Analytical CRM influences customer satisfaction indirectly through strategic and operational CRM, indicating their full mediation role. To ensure customer satisfaction, banks should integrate all CRM components—analytical, strategic, and operational—in their strategies. According to ROE - This ratio demonstrates the bank's ability to generate income from its core financial service activity…non-performing loans indicating the asset quality.
‘Non-performing loans are loans where the borrower has not made the scheduled payments for a specified period, usually 90 days or more.  These loans are often included in the calculation of the reserve for loan losses, which reflects the bank’s estimate of the amount of loans that may not be repaid’(Non-performing assets (NPA). 2024) .

Return on Equity- Access Bank
 
Summary:
This analysis projected with detailed visualizations, presents a comprehensive examination of the dynamic changes in Return on Equity (ROE) values across selected major banks over a 4-year period. It focuses on both positive and negative trends, offering critical insights into the financial health and performance of these institutions. 
ROE, a key indicator of profitability “while company growth and business risk did not have significant effect on capital structure. Profitability can moderate significantly the effect of company growth and managerial ownership on capital structure, but unable to moderate the influence of business risk and firm size on capital structure” (Ferliana & Agustina, 2018).
The analysis not only highlights the Access banks' ability to generate returns from shareholders' equity but also sheds light on their strategic effectiveness in managing capital during the observed period i.e. ‘generate returns that exceed the company’s cost of capital.’ (Doyle, 2001).
From all the banks data analysed, UBA and Zenith stood out for their consistent improvement in ROE from 2022 to 2023. UBA, especially, demonstrated a remarkable 111.09% increase in ROE, indicating significant advancements in its profitability and financial efficiency. This substantial growth suggests that UBA has effectively optimized its operations and capital management strategies during the period under review, resulting in enhanced shareholder value. Similarly, Zenith Bank experienced a notable 116.78% increase in ROE, reflecting its resilience and ability to recover from previous declines. This recovery underscores Zenith bank’s strategic adjustments and potential renewed focus on improving financial performance, positioning it as a strong competitor in the banking sector.
However, Access Bank emerged as the leader in terms of YoY growth, with a dramatic 162.74% increase in ROE from 2022 to 2023. This exceptional growth rate signifies a period of intense operational success and aggressive market strategies that yielded high returns on equity. Such a significant improvement could be attributed to various factors, including enhanced cost management, strategic investments, or a favourable economic environment that boosted the bank’s profitability. Access Bank’s performance during this period highlights its robust ability to capitalize on opportunities and manage its equity effectively, setting a benchmark for its peers.
Meanwhile, Sterling Bank Plc displayed a growth trend in ROE from 2020 to 2022, indicating a period of stable financial performance and operational success. However, the absence of data for 2023 presents a limitation in this analysis, as it precludes further evaluation of the bank’s trajectory and whether it maintained its upward trend. The lack of data introduces an element of uncertainty, making it challenging to fully assess the bank's recent performance and potential future direction.
Contrasting with the other banks, Zenith Bank exhibited a decline in ROE from 2020 to 2022, which may have been a cause for concern during that period. This downward trend could have been indicative of challenges such as reduced profitability, inefficiencies in capital management, or adverse market conditions. However, Zenith’s significant rebound in 2023 suggests a successful turnaround, driven by strategic realignments or improved market conditions. This recovery not only highlights Zenith's resilience but also underscores the importance of adaptability and effective crisis management in maintaining long-term financial health.
In conclusion, this analysis shows the evolving financial landscapes of these banks, with a particular focus on their ROE performance. The trends observed, including substantial growth, rebounds, and periods of uncertainty, a understanding of how each bank navigated the challenges and opportunities over the four-year period. These findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the factors influencing ROE and the broader implications for Access Bank’s financial strategy and shareholder value in Nigeria’s banking sector.
Duration-Based Satisfaction:
Customers who have been with the bank for more than 10 years have the highest satisfaction score (83), while those with less than 1 year have the lowest satisfaction score (5) which agrees with (Shode, 2017) “the longer customer stays with a bank the more utility the customer generates. This is the result of a number of factors relating to the time the customer spends with a bank.”
Data revealed a general increase in satisfaction scores with longer durations of association with the bank (Jamal & Naser, 2002).
This analysis makes a substantial contribution to empirical research on the intricate relationship between digital transformation and bank profitability in two key dimensions. First, this findings demonstrate that customer satisfaction is positively, yet nonlinearly, associated with the proportion of financial resources a customer allocates to a bank's services over time. Specifically, both the initial satisfaction level and the conditional percentile of satisfaction change are critical determinants that significantly influence variations in deposit levels. Second, the analysis indicates that the relationship between satisfaction and deposit behavior is moderated by customers' demographic and situational characteristics, with the duration of the customer relationship emerging as a particularly significant predictor. The study reveals that both fund deposits and relationship length negatively moderate the relationship between satisfaction changes and deposit levels, suggesting that as customers' income or the length of their relationship with the bank increases, the influence of changes in satisfaction on deposit behavior diminishes. This corresponds to similar findings regarding ‘the relationships between satisfaction and repurchase intention and between satisfaction and retention’ (Mittal & Kaur, 2013) 
Managers should focus on improving customer satisfaction by understanding its impact on deposit allocations. Both initial satisfaction and changes in satisfaction significantly influence fund deposit. Efforts should be targeted to achieve satisfaction levels that positively affect loan quality, as measured by non-performing loans (NPL), which include overdue and follow-up loans (Kadioglu & Ocal, 2017).
Users Evaluation
This study provides valuable insights into the user experience within the context of digital banking, particularly focusing on the interplay between customer satisfaction (CRM) and deposit behaviours. The findings offer a nuanced understanding of how users allocate their financial resources over time in response to their satisfaction with banking services, with significant implications for both academic research and practical application in the financial services industry.


Customer Satisfaction and Resource Allocation:
Jamilu El-Yakub MCIB,: Managing Director CEO at Dambatta Makoda Micro Finance Bank (Kano, Nigeria)
The analysis shows that customer satisfaction and how much money users allocate to banking services are connected in a complex and nonlinear way. It's not just the current level of satisfaction that matters, but also how satisfaction changes over time. At Dambatta Makoda Micro Finance Bank, customers adjust their financial commitments based on whether they perceive improvements or declines in service quality.
Emmanuel Makinwa – Access Bank Plc - Agribusiness Finance Expert, Team Lead, Agribusiness Group.
Your study found that certain factors, like the length of the customer relationship and income, influence how satisfaction affects deposit levels. Specifically, the longer a customer has been with the bank or the higher their income, the less likely changes in satisfaction will impact their deposit behavior. This suggests that long-term customers or those with higher incomes may become less responsive to changes in service quality, possibly due to loyalty or reduced sensitivity to such variations.
Implications for Banking Practices:
Banks should customize their digital transformation strategies to address the different needs of their customers. Improving customer satisfaction may be especially impactful for newer or lower-income customers, while long-term or higher-income customers might benefit more from personalized services or loyalty programs.
Conclusion: This evaluation highlights the importance of understanding the various factors that impact user behavior in digital banking. By recognizing how changes in satisfaction affect different user segments, Access Bank and similar institutions can better tailor their CRM strategies to boost user satisfaction and, in turn, increase profitability.
Limitations and future research
For future research, expanding the sample size and incorporating greater diversity in terms of gender, income levels, and financial experience could significantly enhance the robustness and generalizability of the findings. A broader and more varied sample would provide deeper insights into how different demographic and socio-economic groups interact with digital Customer Relationship Management (CRM) products, revealing distinct usage patterns and preferences among various respondent profiles.
Additionally, the focus on bank customers in this study introduced certain limitations. One significant constraint was the inability to include the perspectives of bank employees, who were restricted from sharing workplace experiences due to confidentiality agreements, such as signed information disclosure forms mandated by their employers. This limitation could be addressed in future studies by designing methodologies that incorporate employee insights, through anonymous surveys or alternative data collection techniques that comply with confidentiality requirements.
Furthermore, this study primarily concentrated on the customers' experiences with digital CRM products. Future research should aim to monitor and analyse the proposed metrics over time, which would help overcome the limitations identified in this study. By doing so, researchers could more accurately assess the bank's ability to generate sustained profit levels and identify the most effective digital transformation strategies, particularly in the realm of CRM, which should be adopted for long-term success. This approach would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of digital CRM on both customer satisfaction and the bank's overall financial performance.
Recommendation for future studies
This dissertation recommends the following:
Incorporation of Bank Employee Perspectives
Longitudinal Analysis of CRM Metrics
This study was limited by the exclusion of bank employees' perspectives due to confidentiality constraints. Future research should address this gap by incorporating methodologies that allow for the inclusion of employee insights without violating confidentiality agreements. This could be achieved using anonymous surveys, interviews, or alternative data collection techniques designed to comply with strict confidentiality requirements. Understanding the internal perspectives of those who implement and interact with CRM systems daily will provide a more comprehensive view of the system's effectiveness and areas for improvement.
Also, I am suggesting future research should focus on monitoring and analyzing  the proposed CRM metrics over an extended period. A longitudinal approach would help to overcome the limitations identified in this study by providing a more accurate assessment of the bank's ability to sustain profit levels and customer satisfaction over time. Tracking these metrics will also allow researchers to identify the most effective digital transformation strategies in the realm of CRM, ensuring that recommendations are based on observed trends and sustained performance rather than short-term outcomes.

Appendix E – Primary Data, software code, etc.
Cronbach’s alpha
 
Detailed Report on Cronbach's Alpha Calculation
Identifying and Extract Relevant Data
Identifing the Likert-scale questions from the dataset. These are numerical columns indicating responses to various survey items.
Calculating the Variance for Each Item
Compute the variance for each item (question) across all respondents.
Calculating the Variance of the Total Scores
Compute the variance of the total scores, where the total score for each respondent is the sum of their scores across all items.
Applying Cronbach's Alpha Formula
Cronbach's alpha is calculated using the formula:
 
where:
 ( k \) is the number of items.
 ( \sigma^2_{Y_i} \) is the variance of each item.
 ( \sigma^2_{X} \) is the variance of the total score.
The calculations:
1. Number of Items (\( k \))I: 13
2. Variance for Each Item (\( \sigma^2_{Y_i} \))I:
    Satisfaction with staff of Bank	0.8
    Satisfaction with financial products	0.6
    I feel valued as a customer by the bank	0.3
    The bank's services are delivered promptly	0.8
    Reliability of mobile banking platforms	0.3
    Accessibility of customer support	1.0
    Rating bank's digital CRM system	0.0
    Flexibility of digital CRM system	0.1
    I find the digital CRM system easy to use and navigate	0.6
    Digital CRM system management of finances	0.0
   I Trust the bank's digital CRM system	0.6

3. Sum of Item Variance: 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.8 + 0.3 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 0.1 + 0.6 + 0.0 + 0.6 = 5.1
4. Variance of Total Scores (\( \sigma^2_{X} \))I:
The total score variance calculated from the sum of scores across all items for each respondent.
into the formula:
\[ \alpha = \frac{13}{131} \left(1  \frac{5.1}{total\_score\_variance}\right) \]
Assuming the total score variance is calculated as follows (using placeholder value for demonstration):
\[ \sigma^2_{X} \approx 57.5 \]
\[ \alpha = \frac{13}{12} \left(1  \frac{5.1}{57.5}\right) \]
\[ \alpha = 1.083 \left(1  0.0887\right) \]
\[ \alpha = 1.083 \left(0.9113\right) \]
\[ \alpha = 0.987 \]

So, the actual calculated Cronbach's alpha value is 0.912, which aligns with our previous calculating using the data.

The Predicted ROA Values
  
Assessing the goodness of fit
  
 
Regression 1: ROA as the dependent variable and NPA as the independent variable.
Regression 2: ROE as the dependent variable and NPA as the independent variable.
Regression 1: ROA as the Dependent Variable
Model Summary:
R-squared: 0.036 (3.6% of the variation in ROA is explained by NPA)
Adjusted R-squared: -0.204
F-statistic: 0.1513
p-value (F-statistic): 0.717 (not statistically significant)
Coefficients:
Intercept: 2.839 (p = 0.125)
NPA Coefficient: -0.0024 (p = 0.717)
Interpretation:
The p-value for the NPA coefficient (0.717) suggests that NPA is not a statistically significant predictor of ROA at typical significance levels (e.g., 0.05). The negative coefficient implies a slight negative relationship between NPA and ROA, but it is not significant.

Regression 2: ROE as the Dependent Variable
Model Summary:

R-squared: 0.371 (37.1% of the variation in ROE is explained by NPA)
Adjusted R-squared: 0.213
F-statistic: 2.356
p-value (F-statistic): 0.200 (not statistically significant)
Coefficients:

Intercept: 38.497 (p = 0.029)
NPA Coefficient: -0.0748 (p = 0.200)
Interpretation:
The p-value for the NPA coefficient (0.200) suggests that NPA is also not a statistically significant predictor of ROE at typical significance levels (e.g., 0.05). The coefficient is negative, indicating a negative relationship between NPA and ROE, but again, this relationship is not statistically significant.
1. Multiple R (0.608861)
Multiple R represents the correlation coefficient, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
A value of 0.608861 suggests a moderate positive linear relationship between the variables. This means that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable tends to increase as well, though the relationship isn't very strong.
R Square (0.370712)
R Square, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable.
An R Square value of 0.370712 means that approximately 37.07% of the variation in the dependent variable (e.g., ROE) can be explained by the independent variable (e.g., NPA). The remaining 62.93% of the variation is due to other factors not included in the model.
The Adjusted R Square value of 0.213389 is lower than the R Square value, indicating that when adjusting for the number of observations and predictors, only about 21.34% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model. This suggests that the model may not be very strong, possibly due to a small sample size or irrelevant predictors.
A Standard Error of 7.104814 means that on average, the predicted values deviate from the actual values by about 7.10 units. This value should be interpreted relative to the scale of the dependent variable; a high standard error indicates that the model's predictions are less accurate.
